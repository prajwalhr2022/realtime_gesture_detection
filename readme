How to Run
Install Dependencies: Run install_dependencies.py to install all the required libraries.
Setup Mediapipe Holistic: Ensure mediapipe_holistic.py and extract_keypoints.py are in the same directory.
Setup Folders: Run setup_folders.py to create directories for storing data.
Collect Keypoints: Run collect_keypoints.py to collect keypoints data.
Preprocess Data: Run preprocess_data.py to preprocess the collected data.
Train the Model: Run train_lstm.py to train the LSTM model.
Make Predictions: Run make_predictions.py to test the model on the test data.
Real-Time Detection: Run realtime_detection.py for real-time action detection.
